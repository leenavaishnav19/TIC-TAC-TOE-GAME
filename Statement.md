## Project Statement

### Scope
This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. It focuses on providing a simple, interactive, console-based game that allows two players to compete by taking turns. The scope includes board creation, user input handling, move validation, detecting win or draw conditions, and alternating player turns until the game concludes.

### Target Users
- Beginner Python learners looking to understand basic programming concepts like functions, loops, and conditionals.
- Educators and students seeking a straightforward project example for teaching or learning introductory game development.
- Developers wanting a foundation that can be extended with features like AI opponents or GUI interfaces.

### Inclusion
This project includes:
- A fully functional Python script to play Tic-Tac-Toe in the terminal.
- Input validation to ensure user moves are valid and do not overwrite existing cells.
- Automated detection of winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Draw detection for scenarios where no moves remain and no winner is declared.
- Clear board display with labels for user-friendly interaction.

### High-Level Features
- Interactive 3x3 grid representation of the game board.
- Two-player gameplay with switchable turns using 'X' and 'O' marks.
- Robust input processing with user prompts for invalid entries.
- Win and draw condition checking after every move.
- Console output formatting for clean, readable game state visualization.
- Modular code structure with functions dedicated to core game mechanics.
