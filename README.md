## 🎯 Overview

This is a simple, interactive command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game (also known as Noughts and Crosses). Two players take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## ✨ Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Play against a friend locally
- **Input Validation**: Robust error checking for all user inputs
- **Clear Board Display**: Visual grid with coordinate labels
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects winning combinations
- **Draw Detection**: Recognizes when the game ends in a tie
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear prompts and feedback throughout the game
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-understand coordinate system (0-2 for rows and columns)

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses only Python standard library)

## 📥 Installation

1. **Download the game file**:
   ```bash
   # Save the code as tictactoe.py
   ```

2. **Verify Python installation**:
   ```bash
   python --version
   # or
   python3 --version
   ```

3. **No additional packages needed** - the game uses only built-in Python modules!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the game**:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe.py
   # or
   python3 tictactoe.py
   ```

2. **Enter your moves**:
   - When prompted, enter the row and column numbers separated by a space
   - Format: `row col` (e.g., `1 1` for the center cell)
   - Both row and column must be 0, 1, or 2

3. **Take turns**:
   - Player X goes first
   - Players alternate turns until someone wins or the board is full

4. **Win or Draw**:
   - Get three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to win
   - If all cells are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw

## 💡 Example Gameplay

```
--- Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! ---

   0   1   2
0    |   |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "Invalid input" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you enter TWO numbers separated by a space (e.g., `1 2`, not `1,2` or `12`)

**Problem**: "Coordinates out of range" error
- **Solution**: Both numbers must be 0, 1, or 2

**Problem**: "That cell is already taken" error
- **Solution**: Choose a different empty cell

**Problem**: Game doesn't start
- **Solution**: Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed and run the file from the command line
